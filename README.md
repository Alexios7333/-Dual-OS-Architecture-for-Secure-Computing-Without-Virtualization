Overview
This project introduces a revolutionary dual-OS security model where a trusted "Command OS" orchestrates and monitors all activities performed by an untrusted but full-featured "Superficial OS." The design creates enterprise-grade security without compromising user experience or system performance.
Key Innovation

Physical drive separation instead of virtualization
Zero virtualization overhead while maintaining strong isolation
Epistemic isolation - complete information control
Reactive security analysis rather than continuous monitoring

Architecture Highlights

Command OS: Trusted core that boots from dedicated drive, handles all critical permissions
Superficial OS: User-facing system that can be monitored, wiped, and reset
Process handoff system for seamless transitions between security states
Sensitive input interception to prevent credential theft
Cryptographic integrity checking for persistent security guarantees
