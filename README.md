# Dual-OS Secure Architecture: Epistemic Isolation Without Virtualization

##  Overview

This project proposes a novel **dual-operating system security architecture**: a trusted, minimal **Command OS** controls and oversees an untrusted, user-facing **Superficial OS**.

Unlike traditional sandboxing or virtualization, this model uses **physical drive separation**, **strict information boundaries**, and **reactive integrity monitoring** to provide enterprise-level security — without sacrificing performance or usability.

---

##  Key Innovations

- **Zero virtualization overhead**  
  No hypervisors, no VMs — achieves isolation without the cost of virtualization.
  
- **Epistemic isolation**  
  Prevents the untrusted OS from *knowing* or *influencing* core system behavior beyond its allowed scope.
  
- **Reactive, not passive**  
  Security based on **predefined behavioral models** and **cryptographic verification**, rather than continuous monitoring.

##  Architecture Highlights

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Command OS** | Trusted control layer, boots independently, authorizes all system-critical actions |
| **Superficial OS** | User-facing system, can be monitored, reset, or wiped as needed |
| **Process handoff layer** | Bridges execution between OS environments safely |
| **Secure input gateway** | Intercepts sensitive input (passwords, keys) to avoid credential theft |
| **Cryptographic auditing** | Verifies file system, memory state, and execution paths |

##  Current Status

**Research Phase** – Research Phase: Core design and architectural analysis have been completed. A detailed document outlining the components for a Zero Trust testbed—built from readily available, low-cost parts—has now been published.
Looking for feedback, collaborators, and potential proof-of-concept builders.
